       Since we duplicated 5 times, this is -100% / 5 = -20% of the total content width.
       However, for a real marquee, we want to move exactly the width of ONE copy
       to ensure smooth looping. The actual calculation needs to consider the
       total width of the .marquee-content and the number of repetitions.
       A robust solution might involve JS, but for pure CSS, we need to ensure
       the content repeats such that -100% exactly aligns with the start of a duplicate.
       Let's assume the effective width of one complete set of text is roughly 20% of the
       total 'marquee-content' now that it's duplicated 5 times.
